# Housing Price Prediction
Predicting housing prices that involve regression modeling, where various features of a property are used to estimate its market value. In this project, we aim to predict housing prices and the proximity to the ocean using a dataset containing information about properties such as location, size, age, and income level of residents in the neighborhood.

### Instructions:
This project is organized into the following sections:

- Data Preparation and Exploration

- Model Development and Evaluation

- Feature Engineering and Model Improvement

### Data Preparation and Exploration
1. Loading the dataset housing_data.csv from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable.

3. Handle missing values, if any, by imputation or removal based on the dataset's characteristics.

4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable, as well as identify any patterns or anomalies.

### Model Development and Evaluation
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

2. Train a baseline regression model (linear regression) using the original features.

3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
